# LoveBox

Electronics project I made for my girlfriend. It's inspired by https://en.lovebox.love/, I can send messages to the box and a little heart turns until the box is opened.

This project was highly inspired by [julisa99's](https://github.com/julisa99) project [Lovebox](https://github.com/julisa99/Lovebox). I made some changes to her original project : instead of using an Oled screen, I used a lcd 1602 and added a feature that makes the screen turn off when there is no new message.

This is the [model](https://www.printables.com/model/156756-lovebox-clone-send-love-messages?lang=en) I used for the 3D printed heart.
